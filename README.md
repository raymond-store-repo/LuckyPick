An Android app that generates lotto numbers for you

I created this app for my personal use. Sometimes, I could not think of any lotto numbers to bet on.

May the force be with you!

TODOs:

* Save and load generated numbers.
* Create a generator that will allow the user to set a bias.
* Allows the user to subscribe to a lotto provider and will display results and broadcast(Notifications) them.


SDK (min SDK): Android 5.0 Lollipop
